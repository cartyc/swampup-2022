## About

In our session, we will tell a story of an imaginary company that wants to deliver high-quality software faster to their customers, yet something is holding it back. Our imaginary company learned about DORA assessments and discovered they are a medium-level performer among similar companies in the industry. They needed to improve several things, including automating their CI and CD processes, to go to the next level.

Are you interested in learning how to use the DevOps Research and Assessment program (DORA) and new Cloud Native Solutions for CI/CD? Join our session and learn how to use the DORA program and see a demo of how managed CI/CD solutions like Google Cloud Deploy, JFrog Pipelines, and Artifactory help you implement modern microservices deployments on K8s and serverless platforms!
